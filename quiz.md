## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

* In my own explanation service Oriented Architecrure is enterprise-wide, it is known as a reusable software component it means the business can reuse this for upgrading or developing, it is reliable to use for a business. The SOA make easier for developement and any changes in system without affecting the entire system, in other words it is independent design to lessen if problem occur. SOA also can interact with various type of software components. 

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

* 	1. STANDARDIZED SERVICE CONTRACTS - This will provide a clear and well explained definition of the purpose and the capabilities of the service. This also include on how the process of service, expectations and also some of the restriction of using the system in a formal and standardized service contracts.

	2. LOOSE COUPLING - This will minimize the dependency of components in the system or lessen rellying to each components like service contract, service implementation, and service consumers. Loose Coupling create a specific connection relationship.

	3. ABSTRACTION - This will hide some other details or some other data to avoid the increase of irelevant metadata, or data. In my own opinion it play a big role of designing of service compositions because not all the information is being show and not all the data are accessible for other user just the functions and any other relevant data that may need. 

	4. SERVICE REUSABILITY - From its word 'reusabulity' it can use for developing , upgrading and be more functional for the system. Using this in different application or systems this can also avoid redundancy in development of a software and preserve loosely-coupled in loose coupling, it is convinient to use to explore for diifferent idea on how to improve more. 

	5. AUTONOMY - The autonomy convey on how the functionalities, how to operate the system and any other logic independently and not relying others. This SOA should be marked as important and segregated properly with care.

	6. STATELESSNESS - It refers to independently without relying to others, this service is known more scalable. Statelessness can improve service reuse.

	7. DISCOVERBILITY - This contain suitable metadata to identify and explain the capability to humans/ users. 

	8. COMPOSABILITY - Breaking big problems into little problems to address it step by step and one at a time, splitting it in small can gain the use of reusability principle. This is also a flexible it managed different types of data, exchanging requirements but have similar functions. 

	9. INTEROPERABILITY - This is the standards that all the user can access and communicate, being flexible is a big benefit for user for having different devices/hardware. 

3. Define Microservices.

* Microservice may have simillarities with SOA (Service Oriented Architecture), it collect loosely couples, independently move smaller components or services.In addition microservices is designed to perform a specific function and communicate with other services using protocols. 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

* 	1. INDEPENDENTLY DEPLOYABLE - This benefit concise and independently microservices, it also resizing into small capacity of memory. Small and precise can modify easily. 

	2. RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB - users can choose right tool that is more in sync for development of the system. Choosing right tool in right situation can lessen time, effort and easy to modify. 

	3. PRECISE SCALING - Being individuality or independent can be pricey somehow, removing or deleting some unused components to free up some space and lessen the cost it may take. 
	
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

* Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices is likely similar but interms of the purpose the SOA is independenly enterprise-wide and uses protocol for communication while Microservices is indendently use for application developement. The similarities they have is both SOA and Microservices breaking down, resizing it to smaller and understandable components.

6. Define Web Services.

* Based on my understanding Web Services is a collection of protocols, this used to transfer or exchanging important data's between the application or any systems to create products and processes.  The web Services have the ability to transfer various types of programming language. 

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.

* Exposing the Existing Function on the network - Giving access to use the functionality of the program and make an interaction by the use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)to initiate a request.

* Interoperability - It's not a trouble in terms of allowing different applications to share and communicate with each other. The applications can use .NET ; The Web Services allow application platform and technlogy to be indepent. 

* Standardized Protocol - The Web Services use protocols in exchange or communication of data. The Service Transport, XML Messaging, Service Description, and Service Discovery Layers this are the protocol to ensure the wide range of options , this can also reduce the cost and increase the quality of the application system.

* Low Cost Communication - The other recomendations for using the functionality is using the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) , compare to HTTP it is low-cost internet for application system.


8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.

*XML-Based -  The use of XML Language is for operating system. It is used as a stabdard un creating application or Website. 

*Loosely Coupled - The web service and the costumer is not attach to each other, web service can make changes withouth changing the costumer interaction in the system. It means they work independetly withouth relying with each other. 

*Coarse-Grained - It contains multimple and complex functionalities , this functionalities can work together on any process. The client will easily to understand the process because of not so many terms/functionalities is use in one services. 

*Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous - Based on the definition it is all about on how the process will work there are 2 types od execution service. The 2 types is the Synchronous waits for the certain service to complete specific service, while Asynchronous there is no waiting time and client can invoke a service while performing a function in other words they can do two function simultaneously. This two is advantage in usimg web services.

*Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) - The web services can invoke the procedure, functions and methods using the XML-based protocol to access in diffrent systems even if it is on remotely. 

*Support Document Exchange - On my own explanation in web services exchanging information can be trouble free, using XML that can handle complicated documents. Reviewing a short or simple documentation or complicated documents like big data of information can handle by the web services


9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.

* Provider -  From the word itself the objective of the provider is to provide and creates a web services for client/customer, he/she will deal about what the client wants and elaborate to client who wants to use it. 

* Requestor -  The costumer will request a clear function for the web services this will also include the language for that service like for example, client want web services that is based on .NET language. The requestor is also referred as the client

* Broker -  If the Provider create a web services for the Requestor the function of the broker will review if the web services already exist or succefully created by the provider and will publish it that will allow to alocate the web services by the requestor. This will be visible to client and the requestor.


10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

* SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol purpose is to communicate between application with different programming languages and can run on different types of operating systems like Windows, MacOS etc.

* WSDL -  Web Services Description Language it is a XML based language, based on the word description it describe or explain distinct  ways on how the client will know bout the web services and how to accces ther service. 
 
* UDDI - Universal Description, Discovery and Integration it is a open framework that means it is accessible and an open-source UDDI is also platform-independent. The SOAP, WSDL and UDI is the three major foundation of web services to function and give services to the clients.
